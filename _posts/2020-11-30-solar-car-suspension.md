<h1> Longhorn Racing Solar Car Suspension  </h1>
<p>
Longhorn Racing (LHR) is a student organization at the University of Texas at Austin dedicated to building racing rehicles to compete in a race against other universities across the nation. For the team building a solar car, I was in charge of designing the suspension system for the vehicle. After research about different suspension systems, I designed both a trailing arm and a double wishbone.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Trailing Arm</h2>

<p>
The initial design I implemented was a trailing arm suspension out of consideration for space because I needed to allow sufficient vertical clearance for the rest of the vehicle. The reason for this decision was to accommodate the roughness of the race track since the solar car race was more of an endurance test than a sprint.
</p>
<h2> Double Wishbone </h2>

    />

<p>
 The other design I developed was a double wishbone suspension. The reason for this was because I learned that it was more efficient for the team to manufacture components using welded tubes, so I integrated a design that would take advantage of that. Attached at the end of the tubes are ball joints meant to accommodate the stresses of the wheel motion. Addtionally, the double wishbone design improved steering control while also maintaining the camber angle of the wheel.

<h2>Takeaways</h2>
This process was the first experience I had to apply the modeling skills I was taught in engineering lectures. It was an opportunity to improve my design skills through a real-world application. I learned tips and tricks with Solidworks that helped me get comfortable with the software and a new way to design with consideration of what other teams could be working on for seamless integration into the car as a whole.
